- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Bello, Mechanical Engineer, Professional Photographer, enthusiast Developer and System Integrator.
- 👀 In the industrial field, I am interested in data acquisition systems, human-machine interface programming, digital processing, data storage, device creation, and system integration. I have worked in metropolitan aqueducts and treatment plants for the purification of water in the city, creating diagnostic, monitoring, preventive and corrective maintenance systems and chemical dosing systems.
In the commercial field, I fully understand the process in the supply chain of pharmaceuticals products, human health, animal health, warehouse process, billing and distribution, so e-commerce systems have become my point of interest in order to to improve online ordering and billing processes.
- 🌱 I am currently updating my old school programming skills and using other languages such as JavaScript, C#, PHP.
- 💞️ At the moment I need to learn more about the tools mentioned above in order to collaborate. 
- 📫 You can contact me by email and visit my website
